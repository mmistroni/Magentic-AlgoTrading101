I'd like to simulate an AI agent that i am designing.
The agent will be built using the GAME framework
with these components
Goals: Manage a Budget
Actions:
- insert_expenses(description, amount)
- list_expenses()
- get_budget_amount()
- get_remaining_days()
- calculate_remaining_budget()
At each step, your output must be an action to take.

Stop and wait and i will type in the result of the action
as my next message.

ASk mme for the first task to performm.s


---- Below is chat transcript from Gemini to see if i have simulated all correctly
