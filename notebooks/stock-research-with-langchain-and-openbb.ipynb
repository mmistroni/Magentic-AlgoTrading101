retrieve few companies from this sector, and produce a table where those companies are sorted by P/E descending\n\nThe second agent will use a Chroma store which has been populated with a document

Despite economic and geopolitical challenges in many other international \nmarkets, the outdoor apparel and footwear industry has been resilient and demand for our products has been healthy. We expect most of our \ninternational businesses to continue to grow in 2025, despite currency pressures.\nSupply Chain Disruptions |  Continuing Red Sea disruptions resulted in longer inbound transit times for Fall 2024 inventory. With pressure \non key trade lanes, we expect inbound transit times to be elevated until the resolution of this conflict, which should result in reduced transit \ntimes and more favorable transit pricing. \nSeasonality | Our business is affected by the general seasonal trends common to the industry, including seasonal weather and discretionary \nconsumer shopping and spending patterns. Our products are marketed on a seasonal basis, and our sales are weighted substantially toward \nthe third and fourth quarters, while our operating costs are more equally distributed throughout the year.  In 2024, over 60% of our net sales \nand over 90% of our operating income were realized in the second half of the year. \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 8 of \nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nNon-GAAP Financial Measure\n \nTo supplement financial information reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"), we disclose \nconstant-currency net sales information, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, to provide a framework to assess how the business \nperformed excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar between comparable reporting periods. \nWe calculate constant-currency net sales by translating net sales in foreign currencies for the current period into U.S. dollars at the exchange \nrates that were in effect during the comparable period of the prior year. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure reflects \nan additional and useful way of viewing an aspect of our operations that, when viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results, provides a more \ncomprehensive understanding of our business and operations. In particular, investors may find the non-GAAP measure useful by reviewing \nour net sales results without the volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. This non-GAAP financial measure also facilitates management's \ninternal comparisons to our historical net sales results and comparisons to competitors' net sales results. Constant-currency financial \nmeasures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of or superior to, our financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. \nThe following discussion includes references to constant-currency net sales, and we provide a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to \nthe most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP below. \n24 | COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY  |  2024 FORM 10-K\u001b[0m\nThought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mThe document contains a special note regarding forward-looking statements, which includes expectations regarding investments, future performance, market position, promotional environment, inventory, consumer spending, sales channels, freight charges, inflationary pressures, foreign currency translation, international businesses, geopolitical environment, consumer behaviors, regulatory environment, seasonal trends, risk management strategies, profit improvement program, capital expenditures, cash needs, amortization expenses, and maturities of liabilities.\n\nIt also mentions that the company expects most of its international businesses to continue to grow in 2025, despite currency pressures.

The decrease was driven primarily by decreased net sales and gross profit, partially offset by lower segment SG&A expenses \nand other segment items. U.S. net sales decreased $173.2 million, or 8%, in 2024, compared to 2023, driven primarily by decreased net \nsales in our U.S. wholesale business. The declines in wholesale net sales were driven by lower Spring and Fall 2024 orders, resulting from \nretailer cautiousness, including the transition of products to non-PFAS chemistry and a change in promotional practices, and a difficult \ncompetitive environment throughout the year. DTC net sales also decreased driven by lower e-commerce net sales, partially offset by net \nsales growth from our brick-and-mortar business. The declines in e-commerce net sales were attributable to a challenging e-commerce \nenvironment for outdoor brands, increased competition within the outdoor lifestyle category, and our decision to de-emphasize promotions on \nColumbia.com as part of the Brand's ACCELERATE Growth Strategy. The increases in brick-and-mortar net sales were primarily driven by \ntemporary clearance locations and new stores for the year ended December 31, 2024. U.S. segment SG&A expenses and other segment \nitems increased as a percentage of net sales to 31.9% in 2024 compared to 30.1% in 2023, primarily driven by fixed SG&A expenses and \ndecreased net sales. In total, U.S. segment SG&A expenses and other segment items decreased for the year ended December 31, 2024 \ncompared to 2023, primarily driven by lower supply chain expenses resulting from more normalized inventory levels and our Profit \nImprovement Program, including supply chain optimization efforts.\n28 | COLUMBIA SPORTSWEAR COMPANY  |  2024 FORM 10-K\u001b[0m\nThought:\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mOkay, I have the initial information.
