Usually, you lend your toys to the friends who will return them because you trust them more.\\n\\nNow, let's say someone told you it's okay to lend toys to the friends who might forget because you have lots of toys, and you thought those friends would start remembering to return them. But then, many of those friends forgot to return the toys, and suddenly you didn't have enough toys left to play with or lend to others.\\n\\nThe subprime mortgage crisis is kind of like that, but with money. Banks lent money to people who might have had trouble paying it back (like the forgetful friends), thinking it would be okay. But then, lots of people couldn't pay back the money, and it caused big problems for the banks and the whole economy, like a broken toy store.\""
