        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates how to build a scalable data processing pipeline that uses a Gemini large language model for inference. We will use **Apache Beam** to create the pipeline and its `RunInference` transform to efficiently call the **Gemini API on Vertex AI**.\n",

        "### Key Components:\n",
        "1.  **`GeminiModelHandler`**: A built-in Beam model handler that connects to the Vertex AI Gemini API.\n",
        "2.  **`RunInference`**: A generic Beam transform that manages batching, parallelism, and execution of model inferences.\n",
        "3.  **`DirectRunner`**: We will use Beam's local runner for this example, but the same code can be executed on a distributed runner like `DataflowRunner` for massive scale."

            "*   **Sun protection:** Sunscreen, a hat, and sunglasses are essential.\n",
            "*   **Comfortable footwear:** Sandals or open-toed shoes are popular, but comfortable walking shoes are still important for exploring.\n",
            "*   **A small umbrella or light rain jacket:** For those sudden thunderstorms.\n",
            "*   **Indoor AC:** Be prepared for strong air conditioning indoors (shops, museums, subways) – sometimes a light scarf or sweater can be useful if you're sensitive to cold AC, even after being outside in the heat.\n",
