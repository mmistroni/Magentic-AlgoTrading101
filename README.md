Writing AI Agents using different frameworks
https://google.github.io/adk-docs/get-started/quickstart/#terminal-adk-run

Most of the code in this project has been developed using Gemini

Among the different agents part of this project, we will try to build an agent to manage a budget maintaned in a google sheet.
This agent will be deployed on Google Agent Engine and will be accessed via a Cloud Function which is sitting behind 
an API Gateway.
